## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/N1KH1LT0X1N/ML-Specialization.git
   cd ML-Specialization
   ```
2. **Set up the environment:**  
   Most notebooks use Python 3 and popular libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.  
   Install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If requirements.txt is available)*

3. **Browse and run notebooks:**  
   Open JupyterLab or Colab and explore the course material.
